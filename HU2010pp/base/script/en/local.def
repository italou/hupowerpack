Don't use it too often in quick succession, as the moose have good hearing and you don't want to spook them off.<br offset=10>Consider using the Bull Call and the Antler Scraper together to make for a very lifelike sound of bull aggression in the swampland or woods."

Then get in prone position or move off to a nearby sniping spot and wait for them to notice your decoy and meander in. Make sure to take a good shot, as those pronghorn are fast!"

df_wtaildecoy_s:"Whitetail Decoy"
df_wtaildecoy_l:"Whitetail Decoy"
df_wtaildecoy_desc:"Whitetails are often fooled by decoys, and that is to your advantage. Use it along with the Grunt Call and Buck Urine for best effect. Make sure to place it in a location that makes it visible from long distances, and also affords you a good shot once deer would move in.<br offset=10>You may need to use it later, so remember where you placed it. You pick it up the same way you place it."

df_turkeydecoy_s:"Wild Turkey Decoy"
df_turkeydecoy_l:"Wild Turkey Decoy"
df_turkeydecoy_desc:"The decoys are of a tom (male turkey) and hen (female). In the fall, wild turkeys start to gather. Place the decoys along the edge of the woods. If placed properly, the decoys will lure the birds in. The real birds will see the decoys and will move towards them.<br offset=10>Don't be fooled, the birds are still wary of movement and sound. Try to keep you movements slow and deliberate. If the turkeys hear or see you they will be gone in a flash."

df_tripod_s:"Tripod"
df_tripod_l:"Tripod"
df_tripod_desc:"The Tripod Stand is the perfect choice for a hunting platform out in open country, to help you get a slight advantage in the brush and areas with little elevation. It is a bit noisy, so you will not want to enter it if the animals are in close proximity.<br offset=10>One good tip is that it is also good for hilly terrain. Find a nice hilltop and set the Tripod on the top. You will have excellent visibility in all directions, allowing you to take longer shots, and also to glass the area more effectively.<br offset=10>Often setting up a decoy or bait out quite a distance away, and using the Tripod to keep a good eye on it, will help you get that shot on the wariest of game animals."

df_treestand_s:"Treestand"
df_treestand_l:"Treestand"
df_treestand_desc:"The Treestand is well known to most hunters. It is very effective, but you do need to place it on an acceptable tree, and on the correct side of the tree. To do this, walk up to the tree you wish to place it in, and to the side of the tree you wish it to be facing. Then activate the Treestand. You will then need to enter it using your assigned key.<br offset=10>Often a great way to use a Treestand is to find a valley with a good tree right near the upper edge of one of the valley walls. Place your Treestand there, and wait for animals to use the valley. This is a beautiful way to hunt, and very effective as well."

df_groundblind_s:"Tent Blind"
df_groundblind_l:"Tent Blind"
df_groundblind_desc:"The Tent Blind is very effective for many hunting situations. It can be popped up quickly and just about anywhere except water or a greatly sloped piece of terrain. It is especially effective for bow hunters or muzzleloader hunters who need closer shots. Just remember that some angles get cut off on you, so try to place the blind as close as you can to where you think the animals will emerge and give you a shot.<br offset=10>Using the Tent Blind and the decoys, along with calls, is a very effective and exciting way to hunt."

df_blindbox_s:"Ground Blind"
df_blindbox_l:"Ground Blind"
df_blindbox_desc:"Like the Tent Blind, the Ground Blind is quick to set up and effective. But the Ground Blind is not as forgiving as the Tent Blind, but it does afford you have 360 degree shooting with no interference or bad angles.<br offset=10>Always have a blind with you, if you have the space for it."

df_atv_s:"ATV"
df_atv_l:"ATV"
df_atv_desc:"The ATV is very useful for those exploratory hunts or just checking out the country side. Be careful, however, as the ATV will spook all nearby animals, and many animals that fairly far away. If you bring the Spotting Scope and the ATV, it is a very effective way to cover a lot of ground. Try to stay to the high areas, so that you see any animals the ATV may spook out of hiding. Then stalk then on foot the rest of the way."

df_horse_s:"Horse (Brown)"
df_horse_l:"Horse (Brown)"

They are generally social animals and can be seen in small harems to large herds. In addition to their stripes, zebras have erect, mohawk-like manes.

df_area_alaska_desc:"The state of Alaska is located in the northernmost and largest part of the USA. There are a wonderful variety of wild animals that live in Alaska including black bear, moose, mountain goat, wolf and elk. Alaska is a vast land with some of the most beautiful scenery in the world. Traveling through Alaska is like no other place on earth, offering diversity of landscape and the adventure of a lifetime."

df_area_alberta_desc:"From the rugged mountains to rolling hills and farmland, the Northern Rockies is a hunter's paradise. With a plethora of hunting outfitters, you will have everything you need to have the hunt of a lifetime. Moose, bear, deer, turkey and elk are just a few of the species here for you. Take home a record trophy from this expansive and varied locale."

df_area_arizona_desc:"From tall mountain ranges to grasslands and sand dunes, the Southwest has it all. It is home to turkeys, whitetails, mule deer, pronghorn, elk, mountain goats, bison and cougars. Being in the high desert, water makes for a very important resource. Keep close to the water source and you are sure to bag that record animal. The terrain goes from huge flat expanses to rough mountains, and long shots are the key to success. Bring your canteen and head for the best hunting in the southwest."

df_area_bavaria_desc:"The Bavarian Forest is located in Southeastern Germany. The same mountain range and forest extends across the border into the Czech Republic but is called the Bohemian Forest once across the Czech border. Native animals to the forest include red deer, elk, wild boar and moose."

df_area_colorado_desc:"From the peaks of the mountains to the expanse of the eastern plains, the Southern Rockies is your hunting dreamland. A large variety of animals means that you will have no problem finding the trophy of your choice. Although elk and mule deer are most abundant, there is also a growing population of moose, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, bear, and cougar. The Whitetail deer and turkeys can be found on the plains. The diverse landscape of the Southern Rockies is the perfect place for big game hunters."

df_area_minnesota_desc:"The Upper Midwest is where you'll find some of the biggest White Tail Deer around. You also find turkey, bison, moose, elk, bear and cougar. With a scattering of wooded areas surrounded by farm fields and many sources of water, the animals here have a year round food source. The gentle rolling hills and shallow river valleys make it easy for you to get to the best hunting locations."

df_area_montana_desc:"The rolling hills, dramatic mountains, abundant lakes, grassy plains and diverse wildlife of the Central Rockies offer superb hunting opportunities. Whitetail and mule deer are in abundance. Elk, moose, pronghorn, bighorn, mountain goat, black bear and cougar can also be found inhabiting the unspoiled wildernesses. Grab your gear and get ready for a prime hunting getaway."

df_area_oregon_desc:"The Pacific Northwest has some of the most dramatic landscapes in the country. With the high mountain passes of the Oregon Cascades, the lush greenery of the Columbia Gorge, rugged seacoast and the Ponderosa pines of the high desert, the Pacific Northwest has it all. Turkey, bison, deer, elk, and bear are just the beginning of your hunting options. Because of the plentiful foliage and water, animal populations are at an all time high. This will allow you to carefully choose the trophy you decide to take with you."

df_area_pennsylvania_desc:"The state of Pennsylvania is located in the Northeastern region of the United States. It's rich in densely wooded forests and history. Native animals to this area are white-tailed deer, elk, black bears and is especially known for their wild turkey."

df_area_texas_desc:"The arid area of the South Central Plains makes hunting a true challenge. With little vegetation, cover is hard to come buy. Scouting is the key in hunting this area. Water sources are the prime hunting locations. With long flat plains you'll be able to see far distances. Keep your spotting scope and rifle at the ready. A bow hunter will find this area a true challenge, with little cover your best bet is to setup at your hunting spot early and wait. With luck you'll spot the white tail or mule deer, bison, pronghorn, or turkey of you dreams."

df_area_africa_desc:"Africa is the home of the finest safaris, amazing waterfalls, expansive lakes and of course big game. With some of the best-rated game reserves in the world, Africa offers something for everyone. Hunting is tightly controlled but you will have the opportunity to assist the wildlife managers and have a hunt of a lifetime. Lions, elephant, and wild boar are just a few of the animals available for you to hunt, as is the beautiful and much sought after kudu. With wide-open plains, the terrain is rugged and beautiful. Water is the most important feature that animals are searching for. Herd animals will be active all day, but search for water in the mornings. Prey animals do most of their work in the early morning and late evening hours, when the shadows and light work in their favor."

df_desc0_wtail:"Odocoileus virginanus<br>(there are 38 subspecies)"

df_desc1_wtail:"With over 30 sub-species of White-tailed deer in existence, their range is quite extensive. White-tails range throughout the US and southern Canada as well as Central America and into Bolivia. The coloration varies depending on the sub-species in question and its locale, but generally range from a redder coat in the summer to more grey in the winter. <br offset=10>Whitetails (properly called 'White-tailed deer') generally roam in transitional areas, such as the edges of woods, groups of shrubs, or swamp. The grasses and trees supply not only their food, but also serve as a place to hide from predators, bed, and give birth. A group of deer will live within a 'home range' and will seldom extend beyond it.< br offset=10>Deer will peak physically between 5 and 8 years old, and live to be 10 to 20 years. Depending on location and sub-species, full grown bucks can be between 150 and 300 pounds. Does are slightly smaller and weigh between 90 and 200 pounds. With their intimate knowledge of their home range, deer can avoid danger by just standing still. If the need arises, a deer can outrun most of its predators including bear, wolves, and humans. They have excellent sense of smell and hearing."

df_desc0_buffalo:"Bison bison"

df_desc1_buffalo:"Bison, now commonly known as 'Buffalo', live only in a few parks and private farms in the US. At one time, they roamed all of North America in great numbers preferring the open prairie, but today they are found in all types of terrain.<br offset=10>Bison can get to be over 2000 pounds and have a distinctive hump on their shoulders. The hump is actually a large set of muscles to allow the bison to clear out deep snow to get grasses in the rough and cold winters.<br offset=10>Bison eat a variety of grasses and require water every day.<br offset=10>Bulls and cows both have a pecking order within the herd, and this order is very linear. Higher animals in the order get better breeding, and dominance is determined by strength. Bison can see movement at very long distances and have a very good sense of smell and hearing."

df_desc0_elk:"Wapiti, Large North American deer, Cervus elaphus, or Cervus canadensis"

df_desc1_elk:"Elk and white-tailed deer share much of the same territory, as they have similar dietary and terrain preferences. Elk do tend to avoid dense forests preferring the more open woodland and coniferous swamps. They have an area as large as 600 square miles that they call home. Elk are very social animals and will travel in large herds. These herds are dominated by a single cow. During the mating season, bulls will form harems and protect them from other bulls very aggressively. Elk will graze mostly in the mornings and evenings, staying relatively inactive during the day. Bull elk can grow to over 5 feet at the shoulder and can weigh over 1000 pounds. The large antlers have at least 5 points on each branch and can have a spread of over 5 feet. Not only very social animals, they are also very noisy. Males are known for their bugling, females bark, grunt and squeal, newborns squeal and bleat. Using the bugling call of the male is the best way hunters use to lure in big bulls."

df_desc0_pronghorn:"Antilocapra americana"

df_desc1_pronghorn:"Pronghorns are the second most popular game animal in the US after white-tails. They range from Canada through the western states, and into Mexico. What makes pronghorns very unique is that they are the only species within the family Antilocapridae. They also have a unique 'pronged' antler. Pronghorns are tan above and white below with a short black mane on the neck, and a white rump. Keeping with their unique qualities, they will move during the day, but do have a minor peak of activity at sunrise and sunset. Pronghorns have excellent vision, and can see movement on the horizon. Getting close enough to a pronghorn for even a long shot takes a lot of skill and a little luck. Most hunters stay near watering holes or use decoys to get their trophies. During the winter, herds of pronghorns can number over 1000."

df_desc0_mule:"Odocoileus hemionus<br>(there are 11 subspecies)"

df_desc1_mule:"Mule deer (called black-tailed deer in some parts of the country) live from northern Mexico to the southern parts of Alaska and Canada's Yukon Territory. This species of deer have very large, furry ears similar to those of a mule. The ears of the mule deer measure about 10 inches long in adults. This grey to brown colored deer is about 42 inches tall at the shoulder on average, and has a tail with a black tip. The antlers fork out noticeably when compared to the white-tails' antlers. Mule deer are less aggressive then white-tails. They will often simply run from any threat. More active during dawn and dusk, mule deer are quite inactive at other times. Bobcats, coyotes, black bear, golden eagles and feral dogs are all mule deer predators. The mule deer's home range is similar to the white-tail, depending on season and food supply."

df_desc0_bighorn:"Ovis Canadensis"

df_desc1_bighorn:"Found in the Rocky Mountains, the bighorn sheep inhabits alpine and grassy slopes near to rugged landscape features such as cliffs. Bighorn sheep get their name from the large curved horns which the males bear, although the females also have short horns. The horns of a fully grown male can weigh up to 30 pounds, while the whole animal itself may weigh up to 300 pounds. Bighorns are well known for using their horns in head-to-head clashes between male rams prior to the mating season - it is through this combat that a dominance hierarchy is established, yielding access to ewes for mating. Mainly grazers, bighorn sheep like to eat grass and other plants, but may also seek out natural salt licks. Bighorn sheep have excellent eyesight which they need to navigate the tricky precipice terrain they inhabit, and can see movement up to a mile away. It's difficult to surprise a bighorn, so stick to cover when hunting, move slowly, and try to use salt licks as a lure."

df_desc0_goat:"Oreamnos Americanus"

df_desc1_goat:"The mountain goat was usually found only in the alpine and steep areas of the Rocky Mountains in Alaska and northern Washington. In recent years, they have been successfully introduced to other parts of the country including Idaho and South Dakota. In the winter you can find large groups of mountain goats that gather in the higher elevations. In the summer they spread into smaller groups, or remain solitary, and go into lower elevated terrain. Mountain goats will gather around salt licks in large groups. Cougars and eagle are the mountain goat's main predators. They have excellent vision and can notice small movements from great distances. Like a tree, the age of a mountain goat can be found by counting the rings on the horns. Adult goats can weigh anywhere from 150 to 300 pounds."

df_desc0_grizzly:"Ursus arctos<br>(Ursus arctos horribilis)"

df_desc1_grizzly:"The North American brown bear (also known as the grizzly) have a brown coat that is streaked with grey. The grizzly may grow over 8 feet tall and weigh up to 1700 pounds. They eat most anything they came across from plants and insects to deer, elk, and moose. They have very poor eyesight and just average hearing. With an excellent sense of smell, a North American brown bear can follow a scent for over 2 miles. Grizzlies are mainly active in the morning and evening, but can also be active throughout the day. Bears are generally loners, but their home ranges can overlap. If this occurs, they sometimes gather at major food sources and form family foraging groups. Grizzlies have dominance hierarchies created and protected through aggression. The slow, lumbering walk and movement can be deceiving, they can move very fast over short distances. Brown bears prefer to stick to land, but can be found swimming or fishing. Adults can not climb trees. The North American brown bear has been considered the most dangerous animal for a long time, but often the real danger of attack is exaggerated. They can and will attack humans if the circumstances are correct. Always be alert when in bear country."

df_desc0_blackbear:"Ursus americanus"

df_desc1_blackbear:"The American black bear is the most common bear species in North America. Growing up to around 5 feet long, and weighing up to 880 pounds, the black bear has an excellent sense of smell, and eats a wide variety of food including grass, herbs, fruits, insects, carrion and sometimes rodents. Although generally black in color, subspecies may have coats of different colors including brown and surprisingly - white. The black bear can stand on its hind legs, but mainly to see something better. Attacks on humans are rare, but not unheard of - usually the bear will flee on the first signs of disturbance, but a cornered bear may defend itself aggressively."

df_desc0_moose:"Alces alces<br>(in America it may be called Alces americana)<br>(there are 6 subspecies)"

df_desc1_moose:"At over 6.5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing over 1600 pounds, the moose is the largest member of the deer family. The largest recorded antler spread measured over 86 inches. The Algonquin Native American Indian tribe named the moose, which means 'eater of twigs'. Moose not only eat twigs, but also leaves, grasses, and aquatic plants. The head of the moose is very large with an overhanging upper lip, or muzzle. They also have a drooping growth of hair and skin under the chin called a bell. Moose have fantastic hearing, but very poor eyesight. They have been clocked at over 35 miles per hour, and are very good swimmers as well. The usual live span of a moose is only 5 to 6 years, they can live to be over 20 years old. Male moose use their large antlers to fight off other bulls from mates during the rut. This is a dangerous time for people as well, and moose have been known to attack humans during the rut. In some areas moose attacks are more common than bear attacks. During all seasons except summer, moose will feed on the previous summer's growth of black poplar, aspen, and other trees. In the summer and late spring, they prefer the plants that grow in water. Moose can submerge for over 40 seconds to reach their food."

df_desc0_kudu:"Tragelaphus strepsiceros"

df_desc1_kudu:"One of the most striking and beautiful of the antelopes, the greater kudu lives in central and southern Africa, in rocky hill country or on brush-covered plains. Farmers building fences in areas inhabited by kudu must take into account, the animal's ability to easily leap obstacles 2.5m in height. Kudu males have long, spiral horns; occasionally a female will have small ones. The greater kudu's horns are spectacular and can grow as long as 72 inches, making 2 1/2 graceful twists. The horns are seldom used in defense against predators; nor are they an impediment in wooded habitats - the kudu tilts the chin up and lays the horns against the back, moving easily through dense bush. Kudus frequently use their horns in 'wrestling' matches, locking them together and then trying to push or wrestle the opponent into submission. They have also been observed in a form of play, tossing broken branches into the air with their horns and catching them as they fall. <br>Female greater kudus are noticeably smaller than the males. By contrast, lesser kudus are even smaller, about 42 inches at the shoulder; males weigh around 220 pounds while females generally weigh about 50 pounds less. Lesser kudus have smaller horns than the greater kudus and conspicuous white patches on the upper and lower parts of the neck. Although both species are bluish-gray, grayish-brown or rust color, the lesser has five to six more lateral white stripes, for a total of 11 to 15. Both species have a crest of long hair along the spine, and greater kudus also have a fringe under the chin.<br> Their cryptic coloring and markings protect kudus by camouflaging them. If alarmed, they usually stand perfectly still - making them very difficult to spot. Kudus normaly restrict their movements to a small home range, but the scarcity of food in dry season may force them to roam more widely."

df_desc0_boar:"Sus scrofa Linnaeus"

df_desc1_boar:"Of all members of the pig family, wild boar occupies the largest range. They originally occurred in Europe, Asia, North Africa, and the Malay Archipelago, but were later introduced throughout the world. The wild boar is known for its omnivorous and sometimes indiscriminate diet. They are often stereotyped as unclean animals. The diet includes shrubs, weeds, bird eggs, snakes, grasshoppers, mice, roots, tubers, even manure. Such a wide range of food sources has enabled them to survive in a wide array of environments, from deserts to mountainous terrain."

df_desc0_cougar:"Felis concolor"

df_desc1_cougar:"Also known as the puma, mountain lion, and panther. The cougar is a large and adaptable wildcat. It lives in habitats ranging from snow-covered mountains to tropical rainforests. Cougars are found in every enviroment except the arctic. Adult males can be over 8 feet long and weigh over 180 pounds with the female being 7 feet long and up to 140 pounds. Cougar generally hunt at dawn and dusk. Still, they are active by day in areas undisturbed by man. Instead of occupying a permanent den, Cougars rest and find shelter in caves, among rocky outcrops, and in dense vegetation. They generally migrate from the mountains in winter to follow deer and other prey."

df_desc0_lion:"Panthera leo"

df_desc1_lion:"The lion is the largest of the African carnivores. The lion lives a rather lazy lifestyle, being active for only two to four hours every day. They are most active at night, and rest during the day. A lion pride consists of a group of 2 to 12 closely related adult females with their young, attended by 1 to 6 adult males. Lions differ from other cats by regularly hunting in groups. When hunting small prey, each lion pursues its own animal; with larger and more dangerous prey, co-operation is needed to split a herd or pull down and kill one animal. Male lions can weigh over 400 pounds and be over 4 feet tall with the female weighing in at over 275 pounds and being just over 3 feet tall."

df_desc0_elephant:"Loxodonta africana"

df_desc1_elephant:"The African Elephant is the largest land mammal in the world. Male African elephants grow over 24 feet long and will stand 11 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing up to 14,000 pounds. Males are usually larger than the females. African elephants are known for not only their size, but also their unique features and social structure. These majestic animals live wherever the food and water supply can support them. Elephants are very sensitive to human disturbances, making them move to more remote portions of the savanna. African elephants have a very dexterous trunk and powerful jaws allowing them to gather and process a wide variety of vegetation. Most of the time these creatures will frequent savannas and woodland areas, especially those by streams. African elephants will eat leaves, fruit and bark from the surrounding area. During the rainy season, elephants will diverge their eating habits and prefer herbs and grasses. The social structure is determined by the oldest and largest female. She sets the pace of the group's activities. Elephant herds contain females and young males of about 10 adults and offspring. Male elephants travel in a group of bachelors when they reach puberty. African elephants often travel long distances in search of food and water depending on its availability. The elephant communicates with rumbles, bellows, and moans. Some of their low frequency sounds can be heard over a mile away."

df_desc0_turkey:"Meleagris gallopavo"

df_desc1_turkey:"The wild turkey is native to North America and tends to live in or near heavy woods. The wild turkey will move depending on the season. During the summer months it likes the heavy forest and is solitary, but the late fall and winter months it tends to stay near grazing fields where it can find food easily and gather in groups. The Wild Turkey is an omnivore, foraging for berries, seeds, nuts, insects and roots. Adult Wild Turkeys can weigh up to 30 pounds, however on average they weigh 18 pounds. Wild Turkeys have excellent vision, hearing and tend to be wary, thus making them a challenge to hunt. They are capable of running at speeds up to 25 mph, of flying at up to 55 mph and are able to glide for up to a mile. When it is time to hunt them, search for signs and sounds of the wild turkey. Try to lure the birds in as close as possible using the turkey calls and decoys. You need to be quiet and hidden as much as possible and take slow, careful aim."

df_desc0_wolf:"Canis lupus"

df_desc1_wolf:"The gray wolf, also known as the timber wolf, is the largest member of the Canidae family. Gray wolves are highly adaptable. The height and weight of the gray wolf can vary greatly. Usually height varies between 26 and 38 inches and weight ranges from 44 to 137 pounds. Typically female gray wolves weigh about 20% less than males. Possessing features that are ideal for long distance travel gray wolves are built for stamina. Wolves hunt in packs and function as social predators. Gray wolf packs typically contain 8 wolves, however they can contain between 2 and 20 wolves. Wolves are carnivores, and in most of mainland Alaska moose and/or caribou are their primary food. Wolves communicate visually through a wide variety of expressions and moods. Wild wolves rarely attack humans, wild wolves usually try to avoid contact with humans."

df_desc0_reddeer:"Cervus elaphus"

df_desc1_reddeer:"The Red Deer is one of the largest in the deer species. They were thought to be the same species as the North American Elk, but thanks to recent DNA evidence it has been determined that these are two distinctly different species. Red Deer can be found in most of Europe, Western and Central Asia and Northwestern parts of Africa. In fact it's the only type of deer that inhabits Africa. Red Deer have also been recently introduced to new regions such as Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. <br offset=10>Most stags measure between 69-91 inches and weigh in around 350-530 lbs and hinds measure in a little smaller at 63-83 inches and weigh much less than stags at around 264-374 lbs.<br offset=10>During the summer most Red Deer can be found at high elevations where their food supplies are greater, and during the winter they tend to migrate to more wooded areas at lower altitudes.<br offset=10>Besides hunting Red Deer as a sport many consider the venison to be more flavorful and nutritious than beef or chicken, and in parts of Central Asia Red Deer is a primary source of meat. Red Deer antler velvet is also sold to markets in East Asia for creating holistic medicines."

g_mg_squirrelbash:"Squirrel Bash! Carried over from HU2 - it's a classic! Squirrels are everywhere. The little critters have overrun your backyard, and you'd better make sure they don't overrun your house too. You have just forty-five seconds to shoot as many of them as possible. Each squirrel shot will buy you some extra time and some points for your records, but watch out - these squirrels are fast, and they're gonna get a lot faster... "

What you can see though is a whole bunch of CRAZY animals just begging to be in the sights of your 7mm. Something's not quite right about these animals though. Shoot as many as possible. Each hit gets you extra time and some points. The longer you stay out there, the higher the score-rewards will be! Good luck!"
g_mg_eagleflak:"Buzzard Bash! The buzzards have mutated and are now waging war against you! They have learned how to drop old bombs on you, and are trying their best to make you into buzzrd food. Use your trusty old 9mm pistol and blast the critters out of the sky! You get extra time for knocking down a buzzard, and also for detonating each bomb. Pretty far out, and pretty fun!"
g_mg_deerdrive:"Deer Drive! Your buddies are driving the woods toward you, and you are holding all your party's deer tags! You can only take bucks during this hunt. Shoot as many as possible. Each hit gets you extra time and some points. The longer you stay out there, the higher the score-rewards will be! Good luck! - And of course, this is just a fun game, and is in no way meant to represent actuall hunting and the taking of this many deer. It's a game, have fun!"
